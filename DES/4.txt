 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"Bingley."

"Bingley."
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."

Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom ruled by a benevolent king. The king was known for his wisdom and kindness, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity. The kingdom was rich in natural resources and had a flourishing trade with neighboring lands.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the kingdom. He brought with him tales of distant lands and exotic goods. The king welcomed the traveler and listened to his stories with great interest. The traveler spoke of a rare artifact, a gem of unparalleled beauty and value. This gem was said to possess the power to grant any wish to its holder.

Intrigued by this, the king decided to embark on a quest to find this extraordinary gem. He gathered a group of his bravest knights and set out on a journey that would take them across treacherous mountains, through dense forests, and across vast seas.

Along the way, the group faced numerous challenges. They battled fierce creatures, navigated through unknown territories, and overcame various obstacles. Despite the difficulties, the king's determination never wavered. His courage and leadership inspired his knights, and they remained loyal and steadfast in their mission.

After many months of travel, the group finally reached the location described by the traveler. There, in a hidden cave, they found the gem. It was more beautiful than anyone could have imagined, shining with a light that seemed to come from within.

But as the king reached out to take the gem, a powerful guardian appeared. It was a dragon, with scales as dark as night and eyes that glowed like embers. The dragon challenged the king's right to the gem, questioning his motives and his worthiness.

The king realized that the quest was not just about finding the gem but also about proving his character. He engaged in a dialogue with the dragon, sharing his vision for his kingdom and his desire to use the gem for the greater good. Moved by the king's sincerity and noble intentions, the dragon allowed him to take the gem.

With the gem in their possession, the group made their way back to the kingdom. The journey home was filled with anticipation and excitement. The king knew that the gem had the power to bring even greater prosperity and happiness to his people.

Upon their return, the king used the gem's power wisely. He brought about a golden age in the kingdom, where knowledge, arts, and sciences flourished. The people thrived, and the kingdom became a beacon of hope and inspiration for all.

The king's quest had taught him valuable lessons about courage, perseverance, and the importance of using power responsibly. He became an even greater ruler than before, loved and respected by all. And the kingdom lived in peace and prosperity for many generations, with the story of the king's quest being told and retold, becoming a legend that would endure through the ages."

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
 is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
"What is his name?"
"Bingley."
"Is he married or single?"

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when
